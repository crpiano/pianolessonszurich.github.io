In my classes, my students learn music comprehensively. My personalized lessons do not only focus on repertoire, but also on music theory, sight-reading, ear training, improvisation, and composition. This allows them to express themselves through several styles of music, creating performances full of artistry and musicality, but also to create their own music. They also learn music history through supplementary group lessons and play four hand duets with other students or me. They learn while having fun and they become well-rounded and knowledgeable musicians.  

## Goals

My personal mission is to keep you motivated and committed to playing the piano. With this purpose, I use a method adapted to each student, taking into account what you want to achieve and what you like. They won't only know how to play the piano musically, but also music theory, ear training, composing, improvising, sight-reading, music history, and even chamber music! We'll focus on the topics that you want to learn better.
