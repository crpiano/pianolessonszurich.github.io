Deciding to learn piano is the first step on an incredibly rewarding journey. The instrument you choose to accompany you on this trip will be a daily source of satisfaction, and its presence in your home will change your life and the lives of the people around you. In this post I will give you all the information you need to choose a piano to start learning.

## Minimums of a piano for beginners and options

# What do I have to know before I start looking at pianos?

If you are committed to learning piano you need a good instrument. Many times we think that it is better to buy a cheaper instrument to start, as it involves a lower economic investment. If you do so, you will soon see that your instrument is holding you back in your learning process. For example, if your keyboard only has 5 octaves, how are you going to play pieces that span more? Or if your keys are not heavy, how are you going to develop a good technique?

The fact of having fewer keys or that the keyboard does not weigh will make you frustrated. You will not be able to move forward and, consequently, you will not find any pleasure while practicing. This will make you end up buying a more expensive instrument. In this way, you will have bought two pianos, while if you buy a good one from the beginning, you will save the first one.

It may be that this scares you because you do not know if you will want to continue studying in the future, but I assure you that a good instrument will make you not give up and will increase your capacities for success and enjoyment: an instrument that you like and that responds to your needs, will help you motivate yourself in your practice, giving you more satisfaction and pushing you to continue learning.

But then, you may ask: "do I have to buy an expensive instrument?" You don't have to spend 1000 euros on a first piano. The first question is: how much do you want to invest in an instrument?

1. If you don't care about money or space, the best option will be an acoustic piano (a real piano) or a hybrid piano. An acoustic piano does not lose too much value over time, which will allow you to sell it if you wish in the future, and get back part of the investment.
2. If you prefer to invest less money but have a good beginner instrument, the best option would be a digital piano. This option is the most common to start with.
3. If you want to invest very little money, you could buy an electronic keyboard, knowing that very soon it will become obsolete and will not let you advance.

You can also consider the option of renting a piano or buying a second-hand one, making sure it is in good condition.

# What are the minimums that your initiation instrument should have?

A good instrument to start should have the following minimums:

1. 88 keys.
2. Weighted and dynamically sensitive keys (the keys go down and up through a system of weights and they are sensitive to the difference in force with which the notes are struck, allowing for dynamics, that is, playing with a louder or softer sound)*.
3. Damper pedal or the possibility of putting one. The damper pedal is essential to advance in your piano adventure. It is what Anton Rubinstein called "the soul of the piano" or what Franz Liszt called "the breath of the soul." Thanks to the damper pedal, you can lengthen the notes and increase the expressiveness. You have to make sure, if you choose a digital piano, that it has at least one pedal (acoustic and hybrid pianos have always 3 pedals).

* NOTE: 

In the case of acoustic pianos, the sound is produced by the hammer hitting the strings (it is a percussion system). Depending on the force with which we lower the key, it produces a greater or lesser volume of sound. Once we release the key, by a counterweight system, it returns to its natural position.

In the case of digital pianos and electronic keyboards, the instrument has no strings. Each of the keys creates a sound, which is produced by an electronic sound generator. These sounds are then amplified and emitted through a speaker. Since they don't have the same mechanics as an acoustic piano, they use different techniques to recreate it. The realism of this mechanism varies between different types of digital pianos. For example, there are some which use hammers in imitation of the acoustic piano, getting closer to the real feel. However, others do not have the weighted keyboard. A non-weighted keyboard is not linked to not being able to perform dynamics. Some electronic keyboards have what is called "velocity-sensitive", so that, although they are not counterbalanced, they are capable of capturing the speed with which we press the key and emit a different volume for each type of keystroke.

# So what piano options could I buy?

Before starting with the options, it is important to note that the electronic or household keyboard would not be considered a good beginner-level instrument. It is the cheapest (they usually cost between 180-400 euros) and it is aimed at having fun at home. It is very useful for playing pop or rock songs, as it has a large number of sounds and accompaniments. It's a lot of fun, but it lacks all the essentials of a good starter instrument. It usually has between 49-76 unweighted keys, which will not allow you to move forward and will make you frustrated very soon. Sometimes they have velocity-sensitive keys, which allow you to make a higher or lower volume of sound, but its mechanism is too basic.

Therefore, we will not consider the electronic keyboard, and we will focus on the following options:
1. Portable digital piano and cabinet digital piano 
2. Acoustic upright or grand piano, or hybrid upright or grand piano

## Part 2: Digital pianos

In this post, we will talk about the portable digital piano (also called slab piano) and the console digital piano. Both are digital pianos, but they differ in their portability. The so-called slab piano doesn't have an attached stand, so it is optimized for travel, while the console digital piano is intended to be more stationary at home. They both have 88 weighted, dynamics-sensitive keys. Their price starts usually from 400 euros.

# What things can I take into account when deciding on one digital keyboard or another?

* Sounds and accompaniment. Electronic keyboards are designed for fun, and usually have a large sounds library: they are loaded with rhythmic patterns, accompaniments, and sounds of various instruments. In contrast, digital pianos do not usually have many accompaniments or large sound libraries. They normally have between 5 and 20 different types of sounds (different types of piano, electric piano, harpsichord, organ, guitar, string orchestra ...). After all, you will not need all these functions. Too many extra functions and special effects can be a bit overwhelming and distracting.
* Polyphony. Polyphony is the number of notes that can sound at the same time. In acoustic pianos we have total polyphony, that is, we can make all the notes of the piano play at the same time and its strings will vibrate. In contrast, in electronic keyboards and digital pianos, there are differences in the number of sounds they can generate at the same time. Electronic keyboards typically only produce up to 48, which will not be enough when you start progressing on the piano. The ideal thing would be a digital piano with 256 voices of polyphony or, if that is not possible, at least 192. You may wonder, but isn't it impossible to find a piece where all 88 keys sound simultaneously? Yes, it would be weird, but we are not talking only about the sounds that you can produce with each key or several keys at the same time at a certain moment, but also about the notes that are left sounding when you have your fingers pressing the keys or these keys are sounding by using the sustain pedal. All this will influence the number of sounds. After the limit number of polyphony that your piano supports, the first notes will fade. Therefore, the more polyphony you have, the more complex pieces you can play.
* MIDI or USB connection: it will allow you to connect the piano to your computer or your tablet. It is very useful to compose or to use the different types of software for piano learning. You can also access more sounds or record yourself with ease.
* Transportability: if you are especially interested in transporting your piano, it is better to consider a transportable digital piano than a console one. There are some with very good quality.
* Price: digital pianos vary greatly in price. It will depend on the brand, the model, the type of mechanism... They can also be bought second-hand, since the risk that they are not in good condition is not as big as in an acoustic piano.
* Brands: in the market, you will find many brands that offer digital pianos (Yamaha, Kawai, Roland, Casio, etc.). Many companies have different series of piano models. For example, if we talk about Yamaha digital pianos, you will find the P-Series, Clavinova, Arius... Each of us has different tastes regarding how it sounds or how it feels each piano. The idea is that you try as many pianos as you can until you discover which one you like the best.

# What shall I buy apart from the digital piano?

* It is very important to buy together with the piano:
* An adjustable bench. It is very important to use a piano bench and not a simple chair, as the bench will allow you to correctly adjust your height and maintain a good posture.
* A sustain pedal (if you don't have one). Sustain pedals have different prices depending on how robust they are. The best option is a pedal that is part of the piano stand so that it is made from metal and is weighted. But if you don't want to spend a lot, you can buy a freestanding metal one. Those that are made of plastic are usually very light and slide on the floor. In addition, they usually have an on/off mechanism that does not allow a subtle use of the pedal.
* A stand for the piano (if it is a portable digital piano). It is very important not to put the piano on a table, as it will not be at the correct height (the keys must be 75 cm from the floor). You will be doing yourself a favor if you buy a stand, as it will be the correct height and you will have the correct posture. You should also check that the support is stable.
* Headphones (optional).

## Part 3: Acoustic and hybrid pianos

# ACOUSTIC PIANO

It will give you the original sound and playing experience. The sound of an acoustic piano is created entirely by a physical mechanism, without electronics. This will allow you to enjoy the pleasure of playing an instrument with 100% real sound and mechanics.

Before buying an acoustic piano, it is important to know that this instrument needs constant maintenance since its components are subject to changes in temperature or humidity. An acoustic piano needs to be tuned and regulated frequently and should be placed away from excessive humidity or dryness. It is also a significant investment of money, since buying a cheap acoustic piano is rarely going to be a good option, and if you buy a second-hand one, it is important to get the advice of a piano technician (read more here). The good news is that an acoustic piano does not lose much value over time if it is kept in good condition, and it will also allow you to learn piano in the best conditions.

Acoustic pianos are available in two forms: a grand piano or an upright piano. In the grand piano, the strings are laid horizontally. This means that all the machinery is placed horizontally, making the most of the force of gravity of the hammers, which allows you to enjoy the double escapement action, a very important mechanism for the development of a good technique. On the other hand, in the upright piano, the mechanics are placed vertically, which does not allow this mechanism to be incorporated. In addition, there are differences in the function of the pedals and the sound between both instruments.

Ultimately, the upright piano is cheaper than the grand piano and takes up less space, but an advanced piano student will eventually need a grand piano. Both types of pianos involve a significant commitment because of their high price.

- What acoustic piano shall I buy?

The best way to buy an acoustic piano is to go to the store and test them on the spot with a professional. The best brands would be: Steinway & Sons, Kawai, Yamaha or Bösendorfer, among others.

- What if I have troublesome neighbors or I want to study on my acoustic piano at any time without disturbing?

The solution would be to put the Silent mechanism on the acoustic piano or to buy an acoustic piano with this mechanism built-in. The Silent mechanism is a digital module that blocks the contact between the hammers and the strings, allowing you to play the piano with headphones. There are several Silent options, depending on the price. However, if you will be playing the acoustic piano most of the time with the silent system, it is advisable to buy a hybrid piano, since if the hammers and strings are not used, they will end up getting out of tune and not regulated over time.

# HYBRID PIANOS

Hybrid pianos, whether upright or grand, have the mechanics of acoustic pianos, but the generation and emission of sound are electronic. This allows you to play with headphones while feeling the authenticity of an acoustic piano. Also, they don't need as much maintenance as acoustic pianos. From time to time they will need some adjustment in some of the parts of the mechanism. Depending on the model, they are cheaper than acoustic pianos. Kawai or Yamaha are very good brands for this type of piano.

## Part 4: Second hand pianos

What if you want to buy a second-hand piano to save money? If the piano is digital, it is easier to check its condition, but, as we have seen before, buying a second-hand acoustic piano has some risks. If you go to a store to try second-hand or restored pianos, it is very important to have the help of a professional who does not belong to that store who can review it objectively. Bargains are not usually a good option. 

Apart from knowing the history of that particular piano, the professional will check the following elements:
- The internal state of the machinery (review of hammers, dampers, strings, pins, felts, movements, etc.).
- The state of the keyboard (touch, response, conservation status, regulation equality).
- The state of the woods (check the harmonic table, it must not be cracked or damaged, and the exterior furniture).
- The sonority and tuning (check if the piano is very out of tune because its strings are loose or do not support the tension, sound quality, tone, warmth, shrillness ...).

In the following videos, you will find important tips to evaluate a used piano.

## Part 5: Where shall I buy the piano?

There are three main places where you can buy a piano: a store specializing in music or pianos, a private seller, or online. If you want a specific brand, you can check where you can buy it in the dealer locators that I have left linked in this table, where I specify the different types of digital pianos. 

Specialized stores are a good choice, since you will be able to find many pianos, which you can try, and you will find professionals who will help you with your choice. They will make sure that the piano works correctly, they will facilitate the transport of the piano and its tuning (if it is an acoustic piano), they will recommend you tuners or piano technicians in the area, they will give you guarantees, they will offer you rental programs for your piano to a month for example (so you can try it without risking), etc. In addition, you will be supporting the local business and the local piano and music community. You will see that many of these piano shops offer music events and promote local teachers.

As for the private seller, you may have a friend or acquaintance who wants to get rid of the piano. In this case, it is important that you make sure that it is in good condition. If you are going to buy an acoustic piano, it is important that you go to a specialist technician to have it analyzed. Usually buying a cheap piano is not a good option. In addition, you have to be responsible for transporting it, tuning it and, if it is needed, repairing it. You do not know the life that the piano has had, so it is important to make sure that it is in good condition.

Finally, buying the piano online has its advantages: you can compare prices, read reviews, etc., but it is advisable to buy online once you have decided which brand and model you want, and always in the case of digital pianos. In the case of acoustic pianos, it is necessary to test them first.

In short, it is important to go to the store first and then, if you want, check online. Try out different instruments and bring a piano teacher or technician with you to help you decide on the spot.

## Part 6: Conclusions

Choosing a good piano to start with, can be overwhelming. Although there are so many options, it is important to keep in mind what our objective is, and what we are willing to invest, since this investment will involve a long-term commitment. Choosing a good piano will fill you with satisfaction and will boost your study. That is why I recommend buying a good instrument, since this will mean a clear commitment to making the piano part of your life, and at the same time it will give you the possibility to move forward and enjoy the journey.

For this reason, I would exclude electronic keyboards and start considering from a portable digital piano. If you are not sure which piano to buy, try several and ask pianists and piano technicians. In the end you will surely find one that is perfect for you.

You should remember also that the most important thing is to dedicate a lot of time to practice: after all, a good instrument will not make you a good pianist if you do not dedicate time to it. It is always better to buy a basic instrument and work with it as much as possible, than to spend a fortune on an expensive instrument and trust that it will make you a great pianist without effort.

In the following grid you have a summary of which piano would be the best for you depending on your expectations (what sound you want to achieve, how much money you want to spend, how much space you have, etc.):
