A program specifically designed for children between 4 to 10 years old, where they learn not only the basics of piano playing, but all the necessary skills to become well-rounded musicians.

In my classes, my students learn music comprehensively. My personalized lessons do not only focus on repertoire, but also on music theory, sight-reading, ear training, improvisation, and composition. This allows them to express themselves through several styles of music, creating performances full of artistry and musicality, but also to create their own music. They also learn music history through supplementary group lessons and play four hands duets with other students or me. They learn while having fun and they become well-rounded and knowledgeable musicians.

## Goals

My personal mission is to keep children motivated and committed to playing the piano. With this purpose, I use a method adapted to each child, where the student learns not only how to play the piano musically, but also music theory, ear training, composing, improvising, sight-reading, music history, and even chamber music! The goal is to work on the pieces they love soon!

## My approach

**My approach** | 
--- |
**1. Having fun**. Children learn by playing games that reinforce musical concepts and enhance their learning process in a fun way | 
**2. Using unique materials**. I use a varied and personalized method with materials adapted to each child, that enhance his talents and likes | 
**3. Communicating constantly**. For me it is important to stay always in touch with the children and the families | 
**4. Doing supplementary activities**. Children can share their progress with their family and friends in their recitals, and they can discover new music, pianists, composers, and much more in supplementary activities |
