# About

My name is Clara and I'm a classically-trained pianist and a piano teacher. I fully dedicate myself to my mission: to play the piano and transmit my passion for the piano through teaching. Nothing makes me happier than being able to give students a lifetime of music-making through the piano.

I did a Bachelor Degree in Piano Performance and completed a Master of Piano Performance and Performance Research![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101880157/160488896-f51b71ea-a5cc-4f31-ac2f-6a466deaf0e6.png)
 in Spain. I also obtained the Artist Diploma in Piano Performance. In parallel to completing my piano formation in several piano masterclasses and piano courses, I have focused my work on performing as a soloist and as a member of several chamber music formations and teaching students from different ages and levels. 

They say, “all you need to learn piano is talent and motivation”, but I believe there’s more to it than that...

* I believe strong foundations create great pianists. Through my classes, I aim to give my students the techniques they need to practice correctly and create performances with plenty of musicality, confidence, and passion.
* I believe commitment, discipline, and effort are the clues: motivation and talent are not enough. That's why I'm my students' coach during their learning process.
* I believe in the powerful tool that the piano is for self-expression, communication, and mental well-being. The piano is more than just a beautiful instrument: it is a way of life.
* I believe in the importance of sharing your passion and your successes, and setting goals that make you feel focused and keep track of your progress.

Learning music...

* Connects you with others. It breaks barriers, brings people together, and creates beautiful communities of people that share the same goals.
* Changes your life, makes you reconnect with your inner self, opens up the possibility of expressing yourself through a unique language, and creates an intimate bond between the music and you.
* Creates a new appreciation and perception for the music. It gives you an understanding from the insight of it, and a way to express yourself through the music language.

**So I have one mission... making music part of my students' lifes!**
