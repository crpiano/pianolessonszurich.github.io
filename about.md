My name is Clara and I'm a classically-trained pianist and a piano teacher from Spain, where I studied piano and worked as a piano teacher for more than 7 years. I recently moved to Zürich, where I keep dedicating myself to my mission: to play the piano and transmit my passion for the piano through teaching. Nothing makes me happier than being able to give students a lifetime of music-making through the piano.

## Education

I got the Bachelor Degree in Piano Performance in Valencia, and completed a Master of Piano Performance and Performance Research
in Madrid, where I after obtained an Artist Diploma in Piano Performance. 
In parallel to completing my piano formation in several piano masterclasses and piano courses, I have been teaching for more than 7 years in different music schools and conservatoires. I completed my pedagogic formation in 2019, when I obtained the spanish teaching diploma. I currently combine my work as a professional pianist with teaching students from different ages and levels. 

## My teaching philosophy

They say, “all you need to learn piano is talent and motivation”, but I believe there’s more to it than that...

> * I believe strong foundations create great pianists. Through my classes, I aim to give my students the techniques they need to practice correctly and create performances with plenty of musicality, confidence, and passion.
* I believe commitment, discipline, and effort are the clues: motivation and talent are not enough. That's why I'm my students' coach during their learning process.
* I believe in the powerful tool that the piano is for self-expression, communication, and mental well-being. The piano is more than just a beautiful instrument: it is a way of life.
* I believe in the importance of sharing your passion and your successes, and setting goals that make you feel focused and keep track of your progress.

Learning music...

>* Connects you with others. 
* Breaks barriers, brings people together, and creates beautiful communities of people that share the same goals.
* Changes your life, makes you reconnect with your inner self, opens up the possibility of expressing yourself through a unique language, and creates an intimate bond between the music and you.
* Creates a new appreciation and perception for it. It gives you an understanding from the insight of music, and a way to express yourself through the music language. 

**So I have one mission... making music part of my students' lifes!**
