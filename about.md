# About

My name is Clara and I'm a classically-trained pianist and a piano teacher. I fully dedicate myself to my mission: to play the piano and transmit my passion for the piano through teaching. Nothing makes me happier than being able to give students a lifetime of music-making through the piano.

I did a Bachelor Degree in Piano Performance and completed a Master of Piano Performance and Performance Research![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101880157/160488896-f51b71ea-a5cc-4f31-ac2f-6a466deaf0e6.png)
 in Spain. I also obtained the Artist Diploma in Piano Performance. In parallel to completing my piano formation in several piano masterclasses and piano courses, I have focused my work on performing as a soloist and as a member of several chamber music formations and teaching students from different ages and levels.
